// .NAME vtkPLYReader2 - read Stanford University PLY polygonal file format
// .SECTION Description
// vtkPLYReader2 is a source object that reads polygonal data in
// Stanford University PLY file format (see 
// http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep). It requires that
// the elements "vertex" and "face" are defined. The "vertex" element
// must have the properties "x", "y", and "z". The "face" element must
// have the property "vertex_indices" defined. Optionally, if the "face"
// element has the properties "intensity" and/or the triplet "red",
// "green", and "blue"; these are read and added as scalars to the
// output data.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkPLYWriter
